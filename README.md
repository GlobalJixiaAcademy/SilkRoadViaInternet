# Project SilkRoad Via Internet

Project SilkRoadViaInternet (Chinese: 网络丝绸之路), is inspired by the SilkRoad, a network of Eurasian trade routes active from the second century BCE until the mid-15th century. Silk Road spanned over 6,400 kilometers, which has played a significant role in facilitating economic, cultural, political, and religious interactions between the East and West.

Our world is experiencing profound changes unseen in a century since 2018 since Convid-19 pandemic. The vision of peace and development are facing incredible challenges due to various factor (Brexit, the Russian and Ukraine war, China Threat Theory and etc).

Global Jixia Academy believes that communication without bias is one of the solutions to promoting peaceful and inclusive societies. Therefore, we kicked start our project (SilkRoadViaInternet) at Eddington Cambridge, UK, to build up tools to share thoughts and ideas freely and with privacy reserved. Therefore, we help each other regardless of social and ethnic backgrounds and different genders, sexual orientations, etc.
